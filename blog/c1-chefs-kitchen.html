        <p> October 12, 2014 </p>
    
        <br>
        <p id="blogp1"> When you first hear Shereef Bishay, the founder of Dev Bootcamp, talk, it becomes very clear what kind of experience you are in for. The origin of the program was an experiment; Shereef wanted to see if he could teach his friend to be a Ruby on Rails developer in eight weeks. This story is itself an analogy for DBC. You can learn how to program anywhere, but DBC is where you'll learn to be a developer in more than just title. </p>
        <p id="blogp2"> Analogies work very well for me, and so I immediately understood what it meant to talk about a "menu" mindset as opposed to a "kitchen" mindset. As someone who alternates between being a go-getter and, well, whatever the opposite of a go-getter is, to hear it laid out that the DBC environment is not a passive was important. From what I've seen in the past, being around other people that are trying to move forward, who, rather than try to have their expectations filled, will attempt to take ownership of what they are doing, this type of environment is exciting. I have a great feeling that everyone will feed off of each other, and having met a few Moose already, I think I'm correct about this. I'm ready to get in the kitchen! </p>
