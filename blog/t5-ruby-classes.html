        <p> Map It To Me One Time </p>

        <p id="blogp1"> As a young man, I was nothing but an iterator. If I had to perform a repetitive task, I performed it once, went back to the beginning, performed it once more, went back to the beginning again, and so on. For some especially simple tasks, like shoveling a hole, this makes sense. Generally, however, the ideas of Henry Ford made my methods look foolish over a century ago. Just go back and look at my week 3 solutions.</p>
   
        <p id="blogp2"> Luckily, a whole week later, I became an enumerator. Why loop through what you need to do <i>over and over</i> when you can do all of the work at once?</p>
   
        <p id="blogp2"> As my past and current blog posts have demonstrated, it is easiest for me to explain programming concepts through real-life explanations. Unfortunately, I don't really have the brainspace to explain this one entirely with human situations, so let's talk code. </p>

        <p id="blogp2"> An enumerator is, as I said, a technique that performs an operation on an input. When we "iterated" before, we did something to an input multiple times in a row, but had to give explicit instructions about the step-by-step process of how we wanted to affect the input. With an enumerator, we're trying to get less verbose. Enumerators build the iteration into their structure, and have certain methods, or things they can do to inputs, built in as well. </p>

        <p id="blogp2"> One of the fundamental enumerator methods is map, which loosely defined does <i>something </i> to each member of the input. To put it another way, when we say things.map {something} (using a . implies that we are performing a method), we are doing "something" to each member of the input. Map is a very simple way of telling the program to do that something to everything we tell it to do it to. </p>

        <p id="blogp2"> You'll have to pardon my imprecision, but map is so fundamental to enumerating that I have a hard time explaining it as separate from enumeration. When I think "Enumerate," I think "do this a whole bunch of times to some collection." Well, at the very basic level, "Map" does exactly that! If you want to do something over and over to a collection, forget the iterator; just map it! </p>
