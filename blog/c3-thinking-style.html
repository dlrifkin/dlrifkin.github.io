        <p id="blogp1"> Loosely defined, an Abstract Sequential thinking style focuses on abstraction.Yes, I've defined a term with part of its definition, but I find it important to talk more about what abstraction means to me. I've always been a person who lives in the world of ideas, often to an odd point of withdrawal. I like thinking like this; I enjoy pondering larger schema in the world around me. </p>

        <p id="blogp2"> The issue with A.S. thinking can be in being inflexible. By thinking in this way all the time, I'm avoiding the experimentation and dexterity that comes from "doing."" It's easy to understand the value that comes from doing, of course; we can only learn about certain things by engaging in them. One of the most obvious areas where doing is important is in programming.</p>
 
        <p id="blogp2"> While getting started in the first unit of Phase0, I took my usual approach to learning what it is that I am doing. I read through the readings, I re-read them, and then I sought to simply get an answer to a challenge. What I lacked, and I find I am still lacking, is the ability to start with the phrase "I don't know." Obviously, that phrase is the starting point for any attempt to solve a problem, but I am scared of not knowing. </p>
        
        <p id="blogp2"> As Phase0 continues, I think that this will be my biggest challenge. This portion of DBC is aptly named, because the staff and tutors want us to start from the very beginning. Taking a growth mindset, for me, will be in starting from the beginning point. It will be an attempt at growth on many levels; not only in trying new ways to solve problems, but in having the humility to start at the beginning, and the perseverance to continue after that beginning. This is why feedback is the most important part of Phase0; it will test my stubbornness and will give an honest reflection of my skillset. I don't need to be afraid of those things anymore. All I need is to remind myself how invigorating it can be to get my head out of the sky and get my hands dirty until I find an answer. I am ready! </p>
