        <p id="blogp1"> There has long been an untrue and ill-deserved stereotype of people working in technology as "geeks" or "nerds." As is the case with stereotyping any group of people, the exact definitions of those words are imprecise, subject to change by the whim of the people seeking to wield them. Strangely, however, it<b> IS</b> damning that this stereotype always in some way seeks to insult a man. That beneath the vitriol that people feel towards people working in technology is the implicit assumption that "people in technology" only implies "men who do technology things" should tip us off to something that is undeniably true: women are vastly underrepresented in the field. </p>

        <p id="blogp2"> This is not to say that the tech field will have an equality of genders if women also are made fun of. Let's not make fun of anyone, people! Instead, it points to a larger problem, where women are in many ways discouraged from entering the field and often disregarded if they do become members. Simply looking at my own DBC cohort, women make up only 22% of the group. But how can this be? </p>
 
        <p id="blogp2"> Let's start by talking about barriers. Ideally, nothing prevents anyone with the skills and means to do something should be able to do that thing. Okay, now that our heads are out of the clouds, it's not hard to see why a young woman wouldn't want to join the field. Tons of educational research shows that, beginning early on in their education, girls are discouraged from entering technology, as it is seen as one of the fields that <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2014/wom1985.doc.htm">is "supposed" to be for men.</a> Combine that with the mysteriously <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/fashion/the-innovators-by-walter-isaacson-how-women-shaped-technology.html">subtle scrubbing of important women in tech history</a> (did you know that Ada Lovelace is considered the first programmer?!), and it must seem to young women like entering the field is like navigating uncharted, unforgiving waters. </p>
        
        <p id="blogp2"> To make matters worse, getting into the field doesn't ensure being treated equally. There are of course many disgusting examples of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html">uninviting environment</a> that greet a woman in tech. There are also subtler issues within the profession. In any hiring practices, "culture fit" is a term used to describe how an employer thinks a prospective hire will get along socially in the company. The lack of female presence in technology compounds itself here, as even on a subconscious level it might seem like bringing in women will "disturb the culture." Finally, amongst the technologies that you use most often, count the number of them that have female CEOs. Uncharted waters, huh? </p>
 
        <p id="blogp2"> What can we do about this? There are reasons unique to the tech field to be optimistic. Unlike in most other fields, there is no obvious wage gap between genders in technology. While obviously money isn't everything, it does indicate that female employees are valued by their employers at the same level as male employees. It doesn't take a large leap of logic to say that gender gap isn't because women and men are fundamentally different. Rather, speedbumps along the way keep women from getting in, or even wanting to try getting in, to the tech field. Let's change that.  </p>
