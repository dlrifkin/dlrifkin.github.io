        <p id="blogp1"> Cascading Style Sheets can at times be a very simple language, and at other times make you bang your head against a wall. It's important to realize that each feature has a logical reason for existing. And, of course, not to actually bang your head against a wall. </p>
        <p id="blogp2"> We use CSS to separate the styling of our page from the content of it. The word "page" there is insignificant; our strategy in styling is to define and work with the areas of the white space in front of us on the screen. A popular way to break down this white space is with the Box Model </p>
        <p id="blogp2"> The Box Model (not BM for short) is a way of visualizing parts or the whole of the page. We want to put something on the page; this is called our content. Our content can be text, it can be an image, it can be anything we wish to display. There are then certain parameters that form a "shell" around that content, or element, in the shape of a box, which tell the element where to go on the page.
        </p>
        <p id="blogp2"> The outermost portion of the box is the margin. The margin is used to space the element within the page and from other elements on the page. It does not appear on the page, but is largely responsible for the spacing of elements on the page. Inside the margin is the border, which tells us the area in which the actual content will go. The border can be visible if we give it styling to be such, or can be merely an indicator in our code of where the element will be. Finally we have our padding. The padding allows us to space our content within the element, by telling us where the content itself will be relative to the border.
        </p>    
        <p id="blogp2"> So there we have it. The box model is an important way to think about every piece of information we want to put on the page. It lets us play Tetris on multiple levels with our elements, fine-tuning until they look just right.
